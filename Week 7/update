Changes I made to the homepage of my protfolio site:
Video animation
Changing color of background
Made the down arrow functional
Added my logo
Changed the divs under my big video to be About, Work and Contact instead of Photography, Videography and Code. 
(I changed this because along the line if I want to add portfolio pieces that aren't photos, videos or code it would
be a hassle to create another section for that category of work. On the work page I will possibly put subheadings for the
different work categories)
