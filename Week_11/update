I continued to work on my the photography and videography pages, I added 2 photos and 1 video so far. The next step would be to add more of my project and add modal overlays. I also need to start building out the Code project page, as well as the about me page. I am still debating on wether or not to keep the Conact page since I have links to my Instagram and Linkedin at the bottom of my page. I also added photos to the modules on my front page.
